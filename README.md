## Task 1 - Run the website

For this task all you need to do is make sure that you can run and debug
the website. Use the command below to install all the required tools and
run the website.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

You should see output similar to what is shown below.

```bash
$ npm start

> web-dev@0.0.1 start
> nodemon src/server.js

[nodemon] 2.0.22
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
[nodemon] starting `node src/server.js`
Listening on port 3000...
```

You can now open up a browser and input [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
to see the website running. Assuming everything worked correctly you can proceed
to the next task.

## Task 2 - Build your website
